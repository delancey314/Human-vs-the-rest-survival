#   The Expected Risk and Readiness of Major US Cities for the Upcoming Climate Change


    An MVP that demonstrates supervised or unsupervised learning (and maybe both).
    In the case of supervised learning, picking an appropriate metric to quantify performance, and then use of that metric in cross-validation to arrive at a model that generalizes as well as possible on unseen data. Be prepared for the request: "Describe the process you used to ensure your model was properly fit."
    In the case of unsupervised learning, picking an appropriate clustering method and metric to guide the choice of the number of hard or soft clusters. This should be followed up with a thoughtful discussion as to why the chosen number of clusters is "correct."
    In all cases, discussion of the cleaning and featurization pipeline and how raw data were transformed to the data trained on. Text processing especially requires discussion.
    In the case of classification and class imbalance, discussion of how the class imbalance was addressed. Did you use a default decision threshold, or did you pick a different threshold through out-of-model knowledge (e.g. a cost-benefit matrix and a profit curve.)

Climate Change is upon Us
 
 There is extensive evidence that climate change is upon us.  Last year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released their report showing we are likely to cross the threshold of 1.5 C by 2040. This is a critical threshold is theorized to be a point of no return.

This rise is expected to have significant impact on human life

Furthermore, the risks are increasing.  The Arctic permafrost holds 1600 billion tons of CO2 and methane - twice what is currently in the atmosphere.  This year, multiple studies have been released showing the permafrost will be completely melted sometime between 2030 and 2040. This example from Russia shows that when melting begins, entire hills can be quickly lost.

The earth's natural defense to events to rising CO2 is the carbon sinks in forests, particularly the Amazon Rainforest.  In August 2019 alone,
