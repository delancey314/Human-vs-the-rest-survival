#   Forecasting a plan to avoid human extinction or maximize biodiversity

##  The Trolley Problem
  The focus of this study is to try to forecast a solution to a version of the trolley problem involving human extinction.
  
  A classical ethical problem involves a runaway trolley headed down the tracks with no way to stop it. There are five people on the tracks that will be killed. However, you can throw a switch sending the trolley down a spur with a single person on it that will be killed instead.  Your action will definitely kill someone but not acting kills more.  
 
 ## Our climate trolley is on the tracks
  Trained as an ecologist, I knew that climate change was a true risk that we must try to reverse.  However, due to recent developments, I believe we have passed the tipping point - we are in a mass extinction event and climate change is irreversible. Freshwater lensing (freshwater on top of salt acts  like a magnifying glass due to different refractive properties) is accelerating the melting of the artic and antarctic water reserves. The northern hemisphere permafrost holds ~ 1.5 trillion tons of CO2 and methane which is approximately 1.5 times the total of the current atmosphere. Reliable estimates places all of those greenhouse gases released by 2030.   THe Amazon Rainforest is our largest carbon sink (plants to pull the CO2 out of the air). Scientists estimate is shrunk ~15-20% in the last 50 years.  Due to climate change, massive fires (26,000 in August alone), they estimate we have lost 20-40% this year.  Current estimates are running between 2040 and 2100 for human extinction with most falling between 2040 and 2050 now.  
 
 ### Can we and should we pull the switch?
As a species, humanity needs to start making some difficult ethical decisions. 

  I now believe humanity should ensure our survival over all over costs. However, we may be unsaveable so the better plan may be allow our extinction to allow life as a whole to have a better chance of recovering.  By combining data from disparate sources in an unsupervised learning study, I hope to find underlying factors to help make these tough decisions.  
  
  Is it better to let the 21 endangered species in Bangladesh go extinct so they can use the land to feed their people if we forecast they can't be saved?
